Learning Python is fun!
File handling allows us to store data for future use.
Program Flow:
1.A file named myfile1.txt is opened for writing.
2.The user is prompted to enter multiple strings one by one.
3.The user enters strings, and each string is written into the file as a separate line.
4.The loop ends when the user enters @.
5.The file is closed.
